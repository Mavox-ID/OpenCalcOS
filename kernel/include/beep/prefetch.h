/*
	prefetch(x) attempts to pre-emptively get the memory pointed to
	by address "x" into the CPU L1 cache. 
	prefetch(x) should not cause any kind of exception, prefetch(0) is
	specifically ok.

	prefetch() should be defined by the architecture, if not, the 
	#define below provides a no-op define.	
	
	There are 3 prefetch() macros:
	
	prefetch(x)  	- prefetches the cacheline at "x" for read
	prefetchw(x)	- prefetches the cacheline at "x" for write
	spin_lock_prefetch(x) - prefetches the spinlock *x for taking
	
	there is also PREFETCH_STRIDE which is the architecure-preferred 
	"lookahead" size for prefetching streamed operations.
