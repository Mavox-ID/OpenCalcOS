/**
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_DEFAULT: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put
 *	into as default, usually this means the pins are up and ready to
 *	be used by the device driver. This state is commonly used by
 *	hogs to configure muxing and pins at boot, and also as a state
 *	to go into when returning from sleep and idle in
 *	.pm_runtime_resume() or ordinary .resume() for example.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_IDLE: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *	when the pins are idle. This is a state where the system is relaxed
 *	but not fully sleeping - some power may be on but clocks gated for
 *	example. Could typically be set from a pm_runtime_suspend() or
 *	pm_runtime_idle() operation.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_SLEEP: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *	when the pins are sleeping. This is a state where the system is in
 *	its lowest sleep state. Could typically be set from an
 *	ordinary .suspend() function.
