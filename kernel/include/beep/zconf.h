/* The memory requirements for deflate are (in bytes):
            (1 << (windowBits+2)) +  (1 << (memLevel+9))
 that is: 128K for windowBits=15  +  128K for memLevel = 8  (default values)
 plus a few kilobytes for small objects. For example, if you want to reduce
 the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, compile with
     make CFLAGS="-O -DMAX_WBITS=14 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=7"
 Of course this will generally degrade compression (there's no free lunch).

   The memory requirements for inflate are (in bytes) 1 << windowBits
 that is, 32K for windowBits=15 (default value) plus a few kilobytes
 for small objects.
