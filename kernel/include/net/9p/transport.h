/**
 * struct p9_trans_module - transport module interface
 * @list: used to maintain a list of currently available transports
 * @name: the human-readable name of the transport
 * @maxsize: transport provided maximum packet size
 * @pref: Preferences of this transport
 * @def: set if this transport should be considered the default
 * @create: member function to create a new connection on this transport
 * @close: member function to discard a connection on this transport
 * @request: member function to issue a request to the transport
 * @cancel: member function to cancel a request (if it hasn't been sent)
 *
 * This is the basic API for a transport module which is registered by the
 * transport module with the 9P core network module and used by the client
 * to instantiate a new connection on a transport.
 *
 * The transport module list is protected by v9fs_trans_lock.
