 * The EP93xx has two external crystal oscillators.  To generate the
 * required high-frequency clocks, the processor uses two phase-locked-
 * loops (PLLs) to multiply the incoming external clock signal to much
 * higher frequencies that are then divided down by programmable dividers
 * to produce the needed clocks.  The PLLs operate independently of one
 * another.
