 * Note about PCI IO space mappings
 *
 * To make IO space accesses efficient, we store virtual addresses in
 * the IO resources.
 *
 * The PCI IO space is located at virtual 0xfe000000 from physical
 * 0x90000000. The PCI BARs must be programmed with physical addresses,
 * but when we read them, we convert them to virtual addresses. See
 * arch/arm/plat-iop/pci.c.
