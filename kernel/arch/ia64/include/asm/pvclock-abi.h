/*
 * These structs MUST NOT be changed.
 * They are the ABI between hypervisor and guest OS.
 * Both Xen and KVM are using this.
 *
 * pvclock_vcpu_time_info holds the system time and the tsc timestamp
 * of the last update. So the guest can use the tsc delta to get a
 * more precise system time.  There is one per virtual cpu.
 *
 * pvclock_wall_clock references the point in time when the system
 * time was zero (usually boot time), thus the guest calculates the
 * current wall clock by adding the system time.
 *
 * Protocol for the "version" fields is: hypervisor raises it (making
 * it uneven) before it starts updating the fields and raises it again
 * (making it even) when it is done.  Thus the guest can make sure the
 * time values it got are consistent by checking the version before
 * and after reading them.
