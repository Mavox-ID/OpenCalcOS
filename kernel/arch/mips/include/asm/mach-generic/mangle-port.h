/*
 * Sane hardware offers swapping of PCI/ISA I/O space accesses in hardware;
 * less sane hardware forces software to fiddle with this...
 *
 * Regardless, if the host bus endianness mismatches that of PCI/ISA, then
 * you can't have the numerical value of data and byte addresses within
 * multibyte quantities both preserved at the same time.  Hence two
 * variations of functions: non-prefixed ones that preserve the value
 * and prefixed ones that preserve byte addresses.  The latters are
 * typically used for moving raw data between a peripheral and memory (cf.
 * string I/O functions), hence the "__mem_" prefix.
