 * One non-multiplexed "serial" I/O port ... there can be several of these

 * The "u_serial" utility component exists to do one thing:  manage TTY
 * style I/O using the USB peripheral endpoints listed here, including
 * hookups to sysfs and /dev for each logical "tty" device.
 *
 * REVISIT at least ACM could support tiocmget() if needed.
 *
 * REVISIT someday, allow multiplexing several TTYs over these endpoints.
