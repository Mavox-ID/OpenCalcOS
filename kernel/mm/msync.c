 * MS_SYNC syncs the entire file - including mappings.
 *
 * MS_ASYNC does not start I/O (it used to, up to 2.5.67).
 * Nor does it marks the relevant pages dirty (it used to up to 2.6.17).
 * Now it doesn't do anything, since dirty pages are properly tracked.
 *
 * The application may now run fsync() to
 * write out the dirty pages and wait on the writeout and check the result.
 * Or the application may run fadvise(FADV_DONTNEED) against the fd to start
 * async writeout immediately.
 * So by _not_ starting I/O in MS_ASYNC we provide complete flexibility to
 * applications.
